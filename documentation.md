# Image Preprocessing and Model Inference Script

## Overview

This script is designed to preprocess input images dynamically, ensuring they fit the required input format for transformer-based models. The processed images are then passed to a pre-trained model for inference. The model used in this example is `"5CD-AI/Vintern-1B-v2"`, loaded using Hugging Face's `AutoModel` and `AutoTokenizer`.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Image Preprocessing**: Adjusts images with varying aspect ratios and splits them into smaller blocks if needed.
- **Efficient Memory Usage**: Utilizes `bfloat16` precision for optimized memory usage, making it suitable for large-scale image processing tasks.
- **Transformer-Based Model**: Uses a multimodal transformer model to perform inference on image inputs.

## Preprocessing Pipeline

### Image Normalization
The script uses the ImageNet normalization parameters, which are widely used for models pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset:

```python
IMAGENET_MEAN = (0.485, 0.456, 0.406)
IMAGENET_STD = (0.229, 0.224, 0.225)
```

### `build_transform` Function
This function returns a transformation pipeline that:
- Converts the image to RGB.
- Resizes the image to `(input_size, input_size)` using bicubic interpolation.
- Converts the image to a tensor and normalizes it using ImageNet mean and standard deviation.

### `dynamic_preprocess` Function
This function dynamically adjusts the input image's aspect ratio and divides it into smaller blocks if necessary:
- It calculates the input image's aspect ratio.
- Compares it to predefined target aspect ratios to find the closest match.
- Resizes the image to the appropriate size and splits it into blocks for easier processing.

## Image Loading and Transformation

The `load_image` function is responsible for loading and preprocessing images:
1. It opens the image and converts it to RGB format.
2. It calls `dynamic_preprocess` to resize the image and split it into smaller chunks if needed.
3. Each processed image is transformed using `build_transform` and converted into a tensor.
4. The tensors are stacked and returned as the final output for model inference.

### Code Example:

```python
def load_image(image_file, input_size=448, max_num=12):
    image = Image.open(image_file).convert('RGB')
    transform = build_transform(input_size=input_size)
    images = dynamic_preprocess(image, image_size=input_size, use_thumbnail=True, max_num=max_num)
    pixel_values = [transform(image) for image in images]
    pixel_values = torch.stack(pixel_values)
    return pixel_values
```

## Model Inference

The transformer-based model `"5CD-AI/Vintern-1B-v2"` is loaded from Hugging Face's model hub and is used to generate predictions. The model is loaded with `bfloat16` precision to reduce memory usage and improve processing speed.

### Model Loading Example:

```python
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    "5CD-AI/Vintern-1B-v2",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    low_cpu_mem_usage=True,
    trust_remote_code=True,
).eval().cuda()
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("5CD-AI/Vintern-1B-v2", trust_remote_code=True, use_fast=False)
```

### Saving Model:

The model is saved after processing each batch:

```python
def save_model(model, save_path='/content/sample_data/model_complete.pth'):
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), save_path)
    print(f'Model saved to {save_path}')
```

## Advantages

- **Aspect Ratio Flexibility**: The script can handle images of varying aspect ratios, dynamically adjusting them to fit the required input size.
- **Memory Efficiency**: The use of `bfloat16` ensures efficient GPU memory usage.
- **Modular Design**: The functions are modular, allowing for easy adjustments and customizations for different models or tasks.

## Conclusion

This script is a powerful tool for preparing and processing images for transformer-based models. It handles a variety of aspect ratios and uses efficient memory management techniques to ensure smooth processing, even on large datasets.
